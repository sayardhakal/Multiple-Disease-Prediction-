# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-
In this project, I have built a Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning in Python. I have also be deploying this web app using Streamlit. This web app can predict the diseases such as Diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer  using Machine Learning.

# Problem Statement
Developed a web-based Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning to accurately predict the presence of various diseases, including Diabetes, heart disease, and breast cancer. The system should provided an intuitive user interface for users to input relevant medical data and receive predictions for the likelihood of each disease. 

# Goal and Objective
The goal was to create a reliable and accessible platform that aids in early detection and diagnosis of these diseases, empowering individuals to take necessary actions and seek appropriate medical attention.

# Process
The overall project was done in Spyder IDE launching through anaconda navigator.The deployment of the web app was done using Strealit.It is a is an open-source Python library that allows you to create interactive web applications and dashboards for data science and machine learning projects.
1.I have loaded the saved trained model for each disease prediction.
2. Do step by step process prediction  for each disease .

# Command to run this web page
Go to your anaconda directory and select a button like 'play button' and open terminal . Write the command like this [streamlit run "C:\Users\user\Desktop\Multiple disease prediction\multiple disease pred.py"] replace the existing location of the file with your file location.
